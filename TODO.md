# ðŸš§ TODO

## ðŸŒŸ features

- Add pages for artist info and song lyrics? e.g.
    - `localhost:3000/{artist-name}/`
    - `localhost:3000/{artist-name}-{song-name}-lyrics/`

- Prevent requests for duplicate images in charts and results
    - e.g. if Kendrick Lamar has more than one song in the charts, only
    download the image of him once and reuse it for the other song(s)?

- Make similar artists clickable and have their own page
- Download smaller images?

- Add password reset option
- Add "incorrect password" JS to login page?

## ðŸŽ¨ style

- CSS: Fix input box width on login pages
- Add encoded search parameters to /search url?
    - e.g. `localhost:3000/search?q=kendrick+lamar`

## ðŸ”€ misc

- Add a README
- Reorganise everything into `backend/` and `frontend/`
