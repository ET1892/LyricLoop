## ðŸª² bugs

- Fix artist pages for artists with hyphens in their name
    - e.g. Jay-Z, Mach-Hommy, Ne-Yo

- Charts page is buggy, since the songs come from Last.fm but the lyrics etc.
come from Genius
    - e.g. "tv off" by Kendrick Lamar on the charts redirects to a Turkish
    translation, not the original song. Searching for it works as intended.
    - This might have something to do with the fact that those songs have
    brackets in their name on Last.fm, but not on Genius. e.g. "tv off (feat.
    Lefty Gunplay)" (Last.fm), rather than just "tv off" (Genius).

## ðŸŒŸ features

- Include search query in header and title for results page
    - e.g. "Search Results for 'alice in chains'"

- Prevent requests for duplicate images in charts and results
    - e.g. if Kendrick Lamar has more than one song in the charts, only
    download the image of him once and reuse it for the other song(s)?

- Download smaller images?
- Add a 404 page?
- Add password reset option
- Add "incorrect password" JS to login page?

## ðŸŽ¨ style

- CSS: Fix input box width on login pages

## ðŸ”€ misc

- Add a README
- Make the error messages say which API they're coming from, because I spent
about an hour debugging what I thought was a bug with the Last.fm API that was
actually from the Genius one ðŸ™ƒ
